# Privacy Policy for Tinkerplex Labs Inc.

**Last Updated: May 20, 2025**

## Introduction

Tinkerplex Labs Inc. (“Tinkerplex,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we handle your information across all our games and software products (“Services”).

We design our Services with privacy and simplicity in mind. Most of our products are offline-first and do not collect, transmit, or store personal data. However, we believe in transparency and want to ensure you understand your rights—especially if you're located in the European Union, United Kingdom, or California.

## What We Don't Collect

By default, we do **not** collect or transmit any of the following:

- Personal identifiers (e.g., name, email address, phone number)
- Location data
- Device or hardware identifiers
- Browsing or usage statistics
- Contact lists or social connections

## Local Data Storage Only

Some of our Services store data on your device to enable features like saving your game progress or preferences. This data remains on your device and is **not** transmitted to us or any third parties.

## App Permissions

Our applications request only the minimum permissions needed to function. For example:

- **Storage**: To save progress, settings, or local assets

We do **not** access your contacts, microphone, camera, or location unless clearly stated in a specific product.

## No Analytics or Third-Party Trackers

We do **not** use analytics tools, advertising networks, or embedded trackers. If a specific product includes third-party services, that will be explained in that product’s individual privacy notice.

## Your Rights (Under GDPR and CCPA/CPRA)

If you are located in the European Union, the United Kingdom, or California, you have rights over your personal data—even if we don't actively collect any. These rights include:

- **Access** – You can ask if we hold any personal data about you.
- **Correction** – You can request corrections to inaccurate or incomplete data.
- **Deletion** – You can ask us to delete any personal data we may have (though we generally don’t collect any).
- **Portability** (GDPR) – You can request a copy of your data in a portable format.
- **Opt-Out of Sale/Sharing** (CCPA/CPRA) – You can opt out of any sale or sharing of your data (we don't sell or share it).
- **Lodge a Complaint** – You can contact your local data protection authority if you have concerns about our practices.

To exercise any of these rights, contact us at:

We respond to all valid requests within 30 days.

## Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)

We do **not** process personal data under normal use. If we ever do in future products, we will only do so under one of the following lawful bases:

- Your explicit consent
- Contractual necessity
- Compliance with legal obligations
- Legitimate interests (balanced with your privacy rights)

## Children’s Privacy

Our Services are suitable for general audiences and do not knowingly collect data from children under 13 (or under 16 in some jurisdictions). If we learn that we’ve inadvertently collected information from a child, we will delete it promptly.

---

## Data Transfers

We do **not** transmit user data off your device. If future Services involve data transfers, they will comply with applicable cross-border data protection rules, including the use of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for EU/UK users.

---

## Security

We use best practices in our development process to ensure that all local data stored on your device is handled securely. However, as with any digital service, we encourage users to keep their devices protected with up-to-date software and passcodes.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted here, with the updated date at the top. If we make a significant change, we’ll also notify you through the relevant Service.
